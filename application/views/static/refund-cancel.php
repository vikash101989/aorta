					    <p>The team at Aorta works hard to make sure that they facilitate the processing of accurate
                        medicines as per prescription order and strives hard to service them in right conditions
                        without causing any kind of damage, each time a consumer places an order. However, we
                        recommend that the items are always checked during the time of delivery.</p>
                        <h5>‘Return’ – Definition</h5>
                        <p>
                        Return is simply the action of giving back the service or product that the customer has
                        ordered at Aorta. Here are the following situations during which the action of giving a product
                        may happen:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>When products that are delivered don’t match with the order that you placed</li>
                            <li>When products that are delivered are either near to or past their expiry date</li>
                            <li>When products that are delivered were damaged during transit</li>
                        </ol>
                        </div>
                            <div class="row">
<p><b>Point to Note: </b> In case the product that you receive is damaged, please do not accept the
delivery of that product. After opening the package, if you discover that the product or
medicine is damaged, you can apply for a refund. However, do note that we can’t promise
the replacement of all products as that depends on the availability of the product. In such
situations, we prefer a refund.</p>
<p>During the above mentioned unfortunate situations, in case there’s something wrong with an
order, we would be more than happy to rise up to your concern and address the issue as
soon as possible. You are allowed to raise a Return request through our customer care
within a week from the delivery of the product.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the ‘Return’ request, Aorta will verify the extent of authenticity of the nature
of the request. In case the company finds the request genuine enough, it will immediately
initiate the Return and Refund process. The refund will be processed only when it has got
the confirmation from the vendor regarding the content of the product.</p>
